## Features
- Integrate the ChatGPT model to enable human-like conversation in your Spring Boot application.
- Customize and extend the chat functionality to suit your specific use case.
- Demonstrates how to use AI-powered responses to user queries.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Maven build tool for managing project dependencies.
- A ChatGPT API key from the OpenAI platform (You can sign up at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and obtain an API key).

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/kumarperm66/ChatGPT-SpringBoot.git
cd ChatGPT-SpringBoot


2. Configure your ChatGPT API key:
- Open the `application.properties` file and replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual ChatGPT API key.

3. Build the project using Maven:
mvn clean install


4. Start the Spring Boot application:
java -jar target/ChatGPT-SpringBoot.jar


5. Your Spring Boot application should now be running, and you can interact with ChatGPT through the provided API endpoints.

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

- `/src`: Contains the Spring Boot application source code.
- `/src/main/java`: Java classes and packages.
- `/src/main/resources`: Configuration files, including `application.properties` for API key configuration.

## Usage
This project provides RESTful API endpoints for interacting with ChatGPT. You can use tools like `curl` or Postman to make API requests to:

- `/api/chat`: Send a POST request with user messages to have a conversation with ChatGPT.

Customize and extend the chat functionality in the Java code to suit your specific requirements.

## Configuration
To configure the project and ChatGPT API key, edit the `application.properties` file and replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key.

## Deployment
This Spring Boot application can be deployed to various hosting platforms or cloud providers. Consult the official documentation of your chosen deployment platform for specific deployment instructions.
